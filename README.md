# Trivia-Bot
A Discord bot that will produce trivia questions and answers according to the user's chosen category. Download the trivia_bot.py file, replace the openai_key variable with your own OpenAI key, and replace discord_token with your own Discord application's token. Then you're good to go!

P.S. You may need to fiddle with the settings on the Discord Developer Portal to get the bot working
and added to a Discord server. Please consult the following Discord documentation for more information:
